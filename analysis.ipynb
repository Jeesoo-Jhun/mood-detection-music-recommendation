        "## Introduction\n",
        "This project aims to combine cutting-edge facial expression recognition with personalized music recommendations. By analyzing a user's facial expressions through static images or real-time webcam input, the system classifies emotions into seven categories (angry, disgust, fear, happy, sad, surprise, neutral). Using the detected emotion, the system suggests a playlist or song tailored to the user's mood, leveraging the Spotify API.\n",
        "\n",
        "This innovative solution is poised to enhance user engagement and satisfaction in domains such as entertainment, mental health, and customer experience by delivering personalized, mood-responsive experiences.\n",

        "1. **Analysis**: Exploring and preprocessing the FER-2013 dataset, understanding class distributions, and feature engineering.\n",
        "2. **Modeling**: Building, training, and integrating an emotion detection model with Spotify's API for song recommendations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Each section is designed to systematically guide you through the data science pipeline, ensuring thorough exploration and robust model development.\n",
